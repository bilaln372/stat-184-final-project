### Front Matter

Install supporting R packages with necessary functions and data sets. 

```{r} 

# clean up workspace environment
rm(list = ls()) 

# load packages
library(tidyverse)  
library(mosaicData)
library(DataComputing) 
library(rvest) 
library(mosaic)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate) 

```


###  Your Turn 1: Tidy Data & Data Cleaning (Japan)







###  Your Turn 2: Plot Net Generation Capacity vs Construction Date 



###  Your Turn 3: Scrape & Clean China Data/ Then merge with Japan




###  Your Turn 4: Reconstruct Info Graphic of Japan Reactors (or other country of interest)
